# CSE 185 scRNAseq_Easy
`scRNAseq_Easy` is a Python project with embedded R packages, developed for CSE185. It processes STAR and RSEM result files, checks for correlations, and generates a volcano plot to show differential expression analysis.
The scRNAseq_Easy project will output the results that users specify. Specifically, users can choose to output the Pearson correlation result, the CSV file generated after running the DESeq2 R package, and a volcano plot. These outputs are conditional upon successfully passing the packages/sanity_check.py script.

# Installation instructions

Clone the repository and install the required packages using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/CSE185-Final-Project/scRNAseq_Easy/
cd scRNAseq_Easy
pip install .
```
Alternatively, install directly from GitHub:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/SCRNASEQ_EASY.git
```
Export to your local path (needed if you're using class Juypter Notebook server or if you don't have root authorization)
```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

If the install was successful, you can type `scRNAseq_Easy help` to view the user manual.  

# Basic usage
The basic usage of `scRNAseq_Easy` is:
```
scRNAseq_Easy <group1_zip> <group2_zip> [options] 
```
> **Example**: To run `scRNAseq_Easy` using example files from this repository:
>```
>scRNAseq_Easy dataset/HFD_Rep.zip dataset/Chow_Rep.zip [options]
>```

# scRNAseq_Easy Options

The paths to two zip files are only required inputs for `scRNAseq_Easy`. Users may additionally specify the options below:
* `<group1_zip>`, `<group2_zip>`  Required. The path to two zipped files containing aligned and quantified gene reads processed by STAR and RSEM.       
* `-o`, `--output <output_path>`   Optional. Specifies the path where the output graph will be saved.
* `-m`, `--mapping <file_path>` Optional. A two coloumn file without header. The first coloumn contains the gene ID measured, and the second coloumn contains the corresponding gene name.
* `-p`, `--pearson` Optional. If set, checks Pearson correlation for the data within the group and stop the program.
* `-d`, `--DESeq2 [filter = int]` Optional. If set, passes all the files to DESeq2 to process and stop. The result will be saved in output path if set. The result will be filtered by removing the genes with count lower than `filter`, defult `filter = 0`.  Note: Automatically check Pearson correlation.
* `-v`, `--visual [p-value = int, fod = int]`   Optional. If set, generate a volcano  plot of given data. The plot will have label Up, Down and None based on p-value and fold-of-change(fod) inputted, defult `p-value = 0.05, fod = 0`. Note: Automatically check Pearson correlation and process the data through DESeq2. 

Examples:\
Print Manual for usage:\
  `scRNAseq_Easy`\
or\
  `scRNAseq_Easy help`

Check Pearson Correlation within group:  
  `scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip -o path/to/newdirectory -p`  
    
Process data through DESeq2 and filter out gene with count lower than 10:  
  `scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip -o path/to/newdirectory -d filter = 10`  
    
Generate the visualization of volcano plot with p-value threshold = 0.05, fold-of-change threshold = 2 :  
  `scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip -o path/to/output/graph.png -v p-value = 0.05 fod = 2`

# File format
`-d` option will generate a csv file containing the result dataframe processed by DESeq2, deliminator = '\t'\
`-v` option will generate a volcano plot save as PNG formate.

# Testing
We store test file in `dataset/test_file/*`. In order to test whether our code work or not, we will run our code on the file store inside.
