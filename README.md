# CSE 185 scRNAseq_Easy
`scRNAseq_Easy` is a Python project with embedded R packages, developed for CSE185. It processes STAR and RSEM result files, checks for correlation, and generates a volcano plot to show differential expression analysis.

# Installation instructions

Clone the repository and install the required packages using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/CSE185-Final-Project/scRNAseq_Easy/
cd scRNAseq_Easy
pip install setup.py
```
if the install was successful, you can type `scRNAseq_Easy help` to view the user manual.  

# Basic usage
The basic usage of `scRNAseq_Easy` is:
```
scRNAseq_Easy [options] <group1_zip> <group2_zip>
```
To run `scRNAseq_Easy` using example files from this repository:
```
scRNAseq_Easy dataset/HFD_Rep.zip dataset/Chow_Rep.zip
```

# scRNAseq_Easy Options

The paths to two zip files are only required inputs for `scRNAseq_Easy`. Users may additionally specify the options below:    
* `-o`, `--output <output_path>`   Optional. Specifies the path where the output graph will be saved.     
* `-v`, `--visual`   Optional. If set, runs visualization of the correlation among datasets if set to True.

Examples:
Generate the volcano plot in current directory:  
  `scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip`  
    
Generate the volcano plot in user-specified directory:  
  `scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip -o path/to/newdirectory`  
    
Generate the visualization of correlation and the volcano plot in the specified output path:  
  `scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip -v -o path/to/output/graph.png`

# File format
By default, the output file format is a PNG file, which stores the volcano plot
