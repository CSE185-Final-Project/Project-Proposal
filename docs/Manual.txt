scRNAseq_Easy Manual

Usage:
scRNAseq_Easy [options] <group1_zip> <group2_zip> -o <output_path>

Options:
-o, --output <output_path> Optional. Specifies the path where the output graph will be saved.
-v, --visual   Optional. If set, runs visualization of the correlation among datasets if set to True.

Description:
  This program processes gene result files after running RSEM from two groups. 
It will performs analysis, generates visualizations of the correlation of same type of sample datasets if user specified,
and output the volcano plot.
  The input files should be provided as ZIP files. All files inside the ZIP file should end with '.results'.

Examples:
Without Visualization (Processes two groups by only generating the volcano plot):
  scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip
With Visualization and Output Path:
  Processes two groups and generates a visualization of the correlation.
  scRNAseq_Easy path/to/group1.zip path/to/group2.zip -v -o path/to/output/graph.png
