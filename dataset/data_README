# All files upload are already done with STAR and RSEM. They are the results of RSEM.
Our first datasets come from lab 4 given by professor Gymrek. 
Lab 4's datasets (already preprocessing by STAR and RSEM by professor Gymrek) come from the research paper is “High fat diet-induced changes of mouse hepatic transcription and enhancer activity can be reversed by subsequent weight loss”
